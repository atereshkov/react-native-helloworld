##Simple React native application

###Installing Dependencies

You will need Node.js, the React Native command line interface, and Android Studio / Xcode.

If it is not already installed, then check [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies).

##Running this app

Before running the app, make sure you ran:

```
git clone https://github.com/handioq/react-native-helloworld.git
cd react-native-helloworld
npm install
```

###Running on iOS

Mac OS and Xcode are required.

* Open Examples/Movies/Movies.xcodeproj in Xcode
* Hit the Run button

###Running on Android

You'll need to have all the prerequisites (SDK, NDK) for Building React Native installed.

Start an Android emulator (Genymotion is recommended).

```
cd react-native-helloworld
react-native run-android
```

Note: Building for the first time can take a while.

###Modifying your app 
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

* Open index.android.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
* Press the R key twice or select Reload from the Developer Menu to see your change!
